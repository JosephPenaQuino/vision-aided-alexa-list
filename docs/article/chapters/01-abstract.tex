  This paper presents a system that integrates Amazon Alexa with computer vision technology to enhance the shopping experience in mini-markets within residential complexes. By using AWS services like Rekognition for image processing, Lambda for event handling, and DynamoDB for data storage, the system enables users to interact with their environment through voice commands and visual recognition. This approach allows users to easily discover which are the available products in the mini-market, data that is being updated periodically with the use of computer vision, saving time and effort. The research highlights the potential of combining voice and vision technologies for improving localized retail experiences and demonstrates the cost-effectiveness of using AWS services, with the main operational costs driven by the computer vision component.
